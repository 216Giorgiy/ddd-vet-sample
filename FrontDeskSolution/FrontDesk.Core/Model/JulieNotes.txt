I know this is just a stake in the ground. Thoughts on making it more DDDish....

And on creating stuff to demonstrate ideas we want to teach

Base class for person?
client can inherit person
Name ValueObject (first name + last name)

What aggregates do you anticipate:

Patient (root) with visits and appointments, services/scripts, client, caretakers?
patient: aggregate root
create appt, create visit (including weight taken on arrival,caretaker and some notes), create appt
appt: entity
visit: entity
caretaker: entity, name, contact info
New patient needs to be tied to a client [existing]
Client and caretaker may be the same person but does it matter?



Client (root) with patients and bills/charges based on services, payments?
This patient might be defined differently than the other patient.

lock down the properties with private setters
constrain how values are populated
